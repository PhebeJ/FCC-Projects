            <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released 
                    in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.Its language
                    constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
            </p>
            <p> Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, 
                    object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its 
                    comprehensive standard library.Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. 
            </p><p>Python 2.0,released 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference
                    cycles. Python 3.0, released 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much 
                    Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Due to concern about the amount of code written for Python 2, support for 
                    Python 2.7 (the last release in the 2.x series) was extended to 2020. </p>
            <p>Language developer Guido van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project until July 2018 but now shares his leadership as a member of a five-person steering council.
                    Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has <code>filter</code>, 
                    <code>map</code>,and <code>reduce</code> functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets and generator expressions.The standard library has two modules
                    (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML

                <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page. It uses a special 
                    syntax or notation to organize and give information about the page to the browser. Elements usually have opening and closing
                    tags (eg: <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/ol&gt;</code> ) that surround and give meaning to content.</p> 
                   <p>For example,there are different tag options to place around text to show whether it is a heading, a paragraph, or a list.</p>
                    <p>A paragraph of text. Some information we would like to communicate to the viewer. This can be as long or short as we would like.</p>

            <p>C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973. It was mainly
                developed as a system programming language to write operating system. The main features of C language include low-level 
                access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like
                operating system or compiler development.Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C 
                language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript and many other languages is mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly a superset
                of C language

            <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is
                complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open
                and cross-platform.

                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML.</p>
                <p>Note that CSS is case-sensitive so be careful with your capitalization. CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and 
                    allows you to control:</p>
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>color</li>
                    <li>fonts</li>
                    <li>positioning</li>
                    <li>spacing</li>
                    <li>sizing</li>
                    <li>decorations</li>
                    <li>transitions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are three main ways to apply CSS styling. You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the 
                <code>style</code> attribute. Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within <code>style</code> tags in an HTML document.
                Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML document.</p>
